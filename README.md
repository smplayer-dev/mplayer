# MPlayer 1.14

This is a pached version of MPlayer 1.14. It adds the vo shm. This vo doesn't display anything but copies the image to a shared buffer that can be used by other applications.

I'm testing this to see if I can use it in SMPlayer to display video on Mac OS, which doesn't support the -wid option.
